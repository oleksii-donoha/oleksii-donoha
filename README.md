## rds-port-forward

Do you:

- have a fleet of ECS-based applications
- want to conveniently access AWS RDS DB locally for development or debugging?

You're in luck, `rds-port-forward` wraps existing AWS CLI functionality to provide a more streamlined experience. See [more](./libs/rds-port-forward/README.md).
